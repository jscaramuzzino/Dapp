Github commands 
cd .. (dir up)
dir/ls (listing of all files)
git clone (paste url) (clone creates repository and creates a folder with that name)
git status (shows difference between comp files and cloud files )
git add filename (add files into project)
git commit -m(message: can describe changes) “added filename” committed but still on my machine not synched online yet
git push to synch it to GitHub
git pull (pulls down file) (need to be in the git repository folder for the commands to work)
git add . (does everything in dir) ~A also works 

typing in git will tell you all the commands and what they do 
if no message(no -m) is added when committing hit esc then type in   :wq
